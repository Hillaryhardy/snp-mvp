### Step 3: Submit Code4STX Application (30 minutes)

**A. Prepare Submission Information**

**Project Details:**
- **Name:** SNP (Stacks Nexus Protocol)
- **Description:** Automated DeFi yield aggregator for Stacks with 12-protocol integration
- **Repository:** https://github.com/mattglory/snp-mvp
- **Category:** DeFi Infrastructure
- **Status:** Production-ready MVP

**Key Achievements:**
- 15 smart contracts (3,200+ lines)
- 28/28 tests passing (100%)
- 12 protocol integrations
- Security hardened
- First sBTC-native aggregator

**Track Record:**

- LearnWeb3 Stacks Developer Degree
- 2+ years software development

**B. Application Form Fields**

1. **Project Title:**
   ```
   SNP - Automated DeFi Yield Aggregator for Stacks
   ```

2. **One-Line Description:**
   ```
   Non-custodial yield aggregator that automatically optimizes returns across 12 Stacks DeFi protocols
   ```

3. **Detailed Description:**
   ```
   SNP addresses the critical gap in Stacks' $161.5M TVL ecosystem where no automated 
   yield aggregator currently exists. Users deposit once and earn continuously across 
   ALEX, StackSwap, Zest, Bitflow, Arkadiko, Hermetica, Velar, STX Stacking, sBTC, 
   Stable Pool, StackingDAO, and Granite - all without active management.
   
   PRODUCTION-READY MVP:
   - 15 smart contracts (3,200+ lines)
   - 100% test success (28/28 devnet tests)
   - Security hardened (first depositor protection, emergency controls)
   - Bitcoin-native (yields settled on L1)
   
   MARKET TIMING:
   - sBTC recently launched (Nov 2024)
   - No existing automated aggregators
   - 3-6 month first-mover advantage window
   
   See comprehensive documentation: CODE4STX-COMPLETE-GUIDE.md in repository
   ```

4. **Technical Stack:**
   ```
   - Clarity v2.0 (smart contracts)
   - React + TypeScript (frontend)
   - Clarinet v2.0+ (development/testing)
   - 12 DeFi protocol integrations
   ```

5. **Repository URL:**
   ```
   https://github.com/mattglory/snp-mvp
   ```

6. **Demo URL (Optional):**
   ```
   (Leave blank - can deploy frontend later)
   ```

7. **Previous Code4STX Submissions:**
   ```
   List your 3 previous successful Code4STX completions
   ```

8. **Team:**
   ```

9. **Funding Request:**
   ```
   Requesting Code4STX grant for testnet deployment, security audit preparation, 
   and mainnet launch support. Funds will cover:
   - Extended testnet testing (100+ users)
   - Security audit preparation
   - Protocol integration testing
   - Community building
   ```

10. **Timeline:**
    ```
    - Phase 2 (Testnet): 2-4 weeks after funding
    - Phase 3 (Audit Prep): 6-8 weeks
    - Phase 4 (Mainnet): 10-12 weeks
    ```

11. **Differentiation:**
    ```
    SNP offers 2x more protocol integrations (12 vs 5-6) than competitors like 
    Hermetica, with higher average APY (16.9% vs ~10%). First true automated 
    aggregator on Stacks - no manual allocation needed.
