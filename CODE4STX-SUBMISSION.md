## 🚀 INNOVATION & IMPACT

### Market Gap Addressed
- **Problem:** Stacks has $161.5M TVL but NO automated yield aggregators
- **Impact:** Users miss 50-70% potential yield due to suboptimal manual management
- **Solution:** SNP provides set-it-and-forget-it automated optimization

### First-Mover Advantages
1. **First sBTC-native aggregator** (sBTC launched November 2024)
2. **Most protocol integrations** (12 vs competitors' 5-6)
3. **Bitcoin-native yields** (all returns settled on Layer 1)
4. **3-6 month window** before significant competition

### Ecosystem Contribution
- Open source DeFi infrastructure
- Reusable strategy integration patterns
- Production-ready architecture examples
- Educational resources for builders
